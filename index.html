      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>I recently completed my PhD in mathematics at the University of St Andrews, supervised by <a href="https://jdbm.me/">James D. Mitchell</a>. 
	      My main research interests are in semigroup theory and computational algebra.
During my PhD, my research has mostly focused on the development of algorithms and software tools for computing with semigroups and monoids, such as algorithms used for the enumeration of congruences of finitely presented monoids, and on the applications of these tools to research problems. In addition, I am interested in classes of finitely presented monoids with interesting combinatorial properties such as the class of small overlap monoids and the plactic monoid.</p>
