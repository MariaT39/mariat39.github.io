I am a PhD student in mathematics at the University of St Andrews. I work as part of the  <a href="http://www-maths.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/pg/pure/Algebra/index.php">algebra and combinatorics research group</a>. My current research is on practical computation with finitely presented semigroups, supervised by <a href="http://www-groups.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~jamesm/">Prof James D. Mitchell</a>.
